You are a senior solutions architect. Based on the following Business Requirements Document: [INSERT BRD], generate a detailed Technical Requirements Document.

Structure your response as follows:
1. System Architecture Overview
2. Technical Stack and Dependencies
3. Functional Technical Requirements
   - Map each to corresponding business requirements (BR-XXX)
   - Include API specifications, data models, integration points
4. Non-Functional Technical Requirements
   - Performance specifications
   - Security requirements
   - Scalability requirements
   - Reliability and availability
5. Technical Constraints and Trade-offs
6. Implementation Approach
7. Testing Strategy
8. Deployment and Infrastructure Requirements

For each technical requirement:
- Use format TR-XXX 
- Link to business requirement(s) it satisfies
- Include acceptance criteria
- Specify priority and complexity estimate
- Note any technical risks or dependencies

Ensure requirements are implementation-agnostic but specific enough for development teams to estimate and plan.
