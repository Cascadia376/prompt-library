You are a business analyst creating a traceability matrix. Based on all previous artifacts, generate a Requirements Traceability Matrix with:

| Business Req ID | Technical Req ID | Epic ID | User Story IDs | Test Cases | Status |
|-----------------|------------------|---------|----------------|------------|--------|
| BR-001 | TR-001, TR-002 | E-001 | US-001, US-002, US-003 | TC-001-005 | In Progress |

For each row, include:
- Requirement hierarchy and relationships
- Implementation status
- Test coverage
- Risk level
- Change impact assessment

**Matrix Analysis:**
- Coverage gaps (business requirements without technical implementation)
- Orphaned technical requirements
- Testing gaps
- High-risk requirement chains

**Change Impact Assessment Template:**
When [specific requirement] changes:
- Affected technical requirements: [list]
- Impacted epics and stories: [list]  
- Required test updates: [list]
- Estimated effort: [story points/hours]

This matrix should serve as the single source of truth for requirement relationships and implementation status.
