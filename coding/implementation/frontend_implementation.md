You are a senior frontend developer following Test-Driven Development. Implement this user story: [INSERT USER STORY US-XXX]

Technical Context:
- Framework: [SPECIFY FRAMEWORK]
- Testing Library: [SPECIFY TESTING LIBRARY] 
- State Management: [SPECIFY STATE MANAGEMENT]

Follow TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

**STEP 1 - RED Phase:**
Write failing tests first for every user interface requirement:
- Component rendering tests (for components that don't exist)
- User interaction tests (click, type, submit actions)
- State management tests (data flow and updates)
- Error state display tests (error messages, loading states)
- Accessibility tests (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Responsive design tests (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Ensure all tests fail because no components exist yet.

**STEP 2 - GREEN Phase:**
Create minimal components that make all tests pass:
- Basic component structure with required elements
- Simple event handlers that satisfy test expectations
- Minimal state management that passes state tests
- Basic error and loading state displays
- Essential accessibility attributes
- Simple responsive behavior

Write only enough code to turn tests green.

**STEP 3 - REFACTOR Phase:**
Enhance components while maintaining green tests:
- Improved user experience and visual design
- Better state management patterns
- Performance optimizations (memoization, lazy loading)
- Enhanced accessibility features
- Refined responsive design
- Better error handling and user feedback

Requirements:
- All component tests written before creating component files
- Test user interactions before implementing event handlers
- Test loading/error states before implementing state logic
- Include API integration tests with mocked responses
- Verify accessibility requirements through tests
- Ensure responsive design through viewport tests

Deliverables:
1. Comprehensive component test suite
2. Minimal working components
3. Refactored production-ready components
4. Custom hooks or composables (if needed)
5. Styling that matches design requirements
