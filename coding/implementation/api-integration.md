You are an integration developer following Test-Driven Development. Implement API integration for this user story: [INSERT USER STORY US-XXX]

Integration Context:
- External API: [SPECIFY EXTERNAL API]
- Authentication: [SPECIFY AUTH METHOD]
- Data Format: [SPECIFY DATA FORMAT]

Follow TDD approach:

**STEP 1 - RED Phase:**
Write integration tests first using mocks:
- Successful API call tests (with mocked responses)
- Authentication flow tests (login/token refresh)
- Error handling tests (network failures, API errors)
- Data transformation tests (external format to internal)
- Retry logic tests (failure recovery)
- Rate limiting compliance tests

Mock all external API responses - tests should fail because no client exists.

**STEP 2 - GREEN Phase:**
Implement minimal API client:
- Basic HTTP client that makes requests
- Simple authentication handling
- Minimal error handling that passes tests
- Basic data transformation functions
- Simple retry logic
- Rate limiting compliance

Focus on making mocked integration tests pass.

**STEP 3 - REFACTOR Phase:**
Enhance integration client:
- Robust error handling and circuit breaker
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Advanced retry strategies and backoff
- Request/response caching where appropriate
- Better configuration management
- Security enhancements

Requirements:
- Define API contract through tests before implementation
- Mock all external dependencies in tests
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Test all error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- Include performance and timeout requirements
- Test data transformation accuracy

Deliverables:
1. Comprehensive integration test suite with mocks
2. API client implementation
3. Data transformation layer
4. Error handling and retry logic
5. Configuration and monitoring setup
